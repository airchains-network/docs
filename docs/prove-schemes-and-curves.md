# Prove schemes and curves

Proof schemes, also known as proof systems or proof protocols, are cryptographic techniques that allow one party (the prover) to convince another party (the verifier) that a certain statement or claim is true without revealing any additional information beyond the truth of the statement. There are several types of proof schemes, each with its own characteristics and use cases.

Since we are utilizing gnark for the creation of cryptographic circuits, it's important to note that it supports two proving schemes: Groth16 and PlonK. These schemes can be implemented using a variety of elliptic curves, including BN254, BLS12-381, BLS12-377, BLS24-315, BW6-633, and BW6-761. To specify the desired proving scheme and the corresponding elliptic curve, an ID is provided within gnark.

**Groth16**: Optimal for situations where the same computational logic is repeatedly proved, making it a go-to for performance-critical applications.

**PlonK**: A jack-of-all-trades in proving systems, accommodating a broad range of circuits with a balance of speed and efficiency, suitable for varied business logic implementations.

### Groth16

Groth16, dating back to 2016, is a pairing-based zk-SNARK widely recognized for ensuring privacy and confidentiality in various applications. Jens Groth described it as a succinct proof system that efficiently verifies complex algebraic relations using elliptic curves' bilinear pairing properties. This protocol is particularly adept at proving knowledge of a witness (a set of field elements satisfying a polynomial equation) about a statement, leveraging algebraic relationships and computations in elliptic curve groups.

#### Key Characteristics

- **Zero-Knowledge Property**: Enables a prover to affirm the truthfulness of a statement without divulging underlying data, meeting completeness and soundness requirements.

- **Succinct Proofs**: Groth16 proofs are notably concise, consisting of just three group elements. This compact size is particularly advantageous for applications like blockchain systems, where minimizing proof size is essential.

- **Protocol Steps**: The Groth16 protocol comprises three key phases: setup, proving, and verification. The setup phase requires a secure and trusted ceremony to prevent vulnerabilities such as attacks or backdoors. The proving phase involves generating a succinct proof, while the verification phase ensures proof validity without revealing additional information.

#### Applications

Groth16 has been adopted in various domains, such as anonymous credentials, privacy-preserving cryptocurrencies, and decentralized finance (DeFi), where preserving privacy and proving correctness are essential

### PlonK

PLONK, introduced by Ariel Gabizon, Zac Williamson, and Oana Ciobotaru, is a general-purpose zk-SNARK scheme that has gained attention for its efficiency. It builds upon prior zero-knowledge proof protocols like SONIC and Marlin, introducing improvements for enhanced usability and efficiency.

#### Key Characteristics

- **Universal and Updateable Trusted Setup**: PLONK features a trusted setup that is both universal and updateable, making it applicable across multiple programs and improving security via a multi-party sequential procedure.

- **Polynomial Commitments**: PLONK uses ""Kate commitments"" as its default polynomial commitment scheme for verifying polynomial equations. It also allows flexibility with alternative schemes such as FRI or DARK, supporting diverse use cases and developer preferences.

- **Efficiency**: PLONK optimizes efficiency by reducing the computational load on the prover, involving fewer polynomial commitments and proof openings, which enhances scalability in practical applications.

#### Applications

PLONK's design, which minimizes the prover's workload and offers a more compact Structured Reference String (SRS), is well-suited for applications where efficient computation and reduced storage are crucial​

## Why we are using Groth16

1.  **Performance Efficiency**: In blockchain applications, especially those involving frequent transactions or operations that require repeated proving of the same computational logic, performance is key. Groth16 is highly efficient in scenarios where the same circuit needs to be proven multiple times, which is often the case in blockchain networks. This efficiency is crucial for maintaining fast transaction times and lower computational costs.

2.  **Succinct Proofs**: The proofs generated by Groth16 are notably short and concise, comprising only three group elements. This is particularly beneficial for blockchain systems where minimizing the size of proofs can lead to significant reductions in storage requirements and network bandwidth, enhancing overall system scalability.

3.  **Zero-Knowledge Property**: Groth16 provides strong zero-knowledge guarantees, allowing the prover to validate the truth of a statement without revealing any underlying data. This is essential in blockchain applications where privacy and confidentiality are paramount, such as in the case of private transactions or confidential contracts.

4.  **Security and Soundness**: The cryptographic strength of Groth16, which relies on the hardness of problems on elliptic curves, ensures a high degree of security. This aligns with the need for robust security in blockchain applications, where the integrity and trustworthiness of transactions are critical.

5.  **Mature Ecosystem and Integration**: Given the widespread use and maturity of Groth16 in various blockchain platforms, there's a robust ecosystem of tools and libraries available. This can facilitate easier integration and implementation in your blockchain projects, especially considering your expertise in Golang and JavaScript, as tools supporting these languages are likely available.

6.  **Compatibility with Ethereum and Other Platforms**: Since you're working on a rollup-as-a-service platform, compatibility with major blockchains like Ethereum is crucial. Groth16 is compatible with Ethereum 1.x (using BN254 curve), making it a suitable choice for applications targeting Ethereum-based rollups or similar environments.

## Choosing an elliptic curve

Both Groth16 and PLONK (with KZG scheme) need to be instantiated with an elliptic curve. with an elliptic curve. And we use `gnark` in our system and since `gnark` supports six elliptic curves: BN254, BLS12-381, BLS12-377, BW6-761, BLS24-315, and BW6-633. All these curves are defined over a finite field
$F_p$
​
Fp​ and have an equation of the form
\[
y^2 = x^3 + b \quad (b \in Fp)
\]

To effectively work with Groth16 and PlonK cryptographic protocols, it's crucial to select the right elliptic curves. These curves must meet several key requirements:

1. **Security**: Ensures the soundness of proofs.

2. **Pairing-Friendly**: Vital for proof verification.

3. **Highly 2-Adic Subgroup Order**: Enhances efficiency in proof generation.

#### Specific Curves and Their Use-Cases:

- **BN254**: Used in Ethereum 1.x. This curve is the only one supported currently, with other curves proposed in EIPs (EIP-2539, EIP-2537, EIP-3026) but not yet integrated.

- **BLS12-381**: Utilized in Ethereum 2.0, ZCash Sapling, Algorand, Dfinity, Chia, and Filecoin. It's recommended for platform-agnostic applications due to its balance of security and practical speed, though it's slower than BN254.

- **BLS12-377**: Ideal for applications requiring one-layer proof composition (proof of proofs). These curves are secure, pairing-friendly, and have a highly 2-adic subgroup order. BW6-761’s subgroup order matches BLS12-377's field characteristic, which is essential for efficient proof composition. They are used in ZEXE, Celo, Aleo, and Zecale.

#### Trade-offs and Recommendations:

- In Groth16, operations occur in three groups (G1, G2, GT), but in PlonK (with KZG), they occur in G1 and GT only.

- BLS24-315 is optimized for G1 and competitively for GT. Paired with BW6-633 in a 2-chain setting, it facilitates efficient PlonK one-layer proof composition.

- This pair is secure, pairing-friendly, optimized for KZG-based SNARKs (like PlonK), and has a highly 2-adic subgroup order. BW6-633's subgroup order equals BLS24-315's field characteristic, crucial for efficient proof composition.

In summary, the choice of elliptic curves depends on the specific requirements of your blockchain application, balancing between security, efficiency, and the type of cryptographic proof system used.
