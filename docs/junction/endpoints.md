# Endpoints

This guide provides an index of network details for the Airchains Settlement Chain Devnet, including their associated RPC and node endpoints.

### API Endpoints

The API endpoint is to allow users to interact with the REST API in Cosmos SDK which is implemented using gRPC-gateway, which exposes gRPC endpoints as REST endpoints. This allows for communication with the node using REST calls, which can be useful if the client does not support gRPC or HTTP2.

### RPC Endpoints

The RPC endpoint is to allow users to interact with Junction's nodes by querying the node's state and broadcasting transactions on the Celestia network.
