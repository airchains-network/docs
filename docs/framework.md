Airchains Framework: Simplifying blockchain innovation with a versatile, secure, and user-friendly toolkit for developers
</span>

The Airchains Framework is a versatile and powerful tool for building your own custom blockchain parts. It works with popular blockchain networks like Ethereum, Solana, and Cosmos, and lets you choose where to store your data with options like Celestia and Avail. It's super secure thanks to robust zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) and fully homomorphic encryption (FHE), which ensures that data stays encrypted no matter what.
